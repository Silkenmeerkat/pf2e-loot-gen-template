# What we got done 06/28
1. Got the first file into the DB to test the logic of our DB schema
2. Confirmed how to query using or ORM. Keleys?
3. Started writing the import function. NOTE, MOSTLY SHIT. 
4. Made the app run again after our complete refactor from the template. 
5. Solved a pesky git caching issue that wouldn't stop commiting my .env file grrrrrr linus, do something right. 


# What to do next. 
1. Import.ts is going to eventually be a file that holds the code for how to source the data from github and write it/confirm it in the db. 
2. Research server side next.js components... I think the right way to do this is make one of those, then from page.tsx? maybe? call it on an interval... maybe like every week? idk. 
4. Research the ORM write statements. 
5. paginate the responses.... we currently only have 1000 jsons in the list.
6. Just write each object to map into a class..... Ugh.... 
7. figure out how to write a migration class instance
